Welcome to Ease The Waiting. This app is designed to ease the waiting for scheduled events in the future, such as special holidays, your birthday, or anything else. 🎉🎂🌴 
It displays the number of days until the event and (optionally) a personal background image for each event.

<b>How it works:</b>

* Just tap the big red button ("Add Event") to add your first event.
* In the next screen:
	* Enter title and date 
	* Optionally, choose a custom background image for this event by tapping the preview field beneath title and date. 📝🗓️🖼️
	* Save event by tapping the big red button that says "Save".
* You will now be back on the main screen and see your event 
* To add more events, either tap the "+" sign in the bottom left, or scroll to the bottom of the event list and tap the "Add New Event" button.
* For a visually appealing experience like in the screenshots, use attractive images!

<b>Features:</b>

* 🔤 <b>2 visual presets</b> - Switch between big and small text modes by tapping the A, resp. B button next to the "+" button in the bottom line.
* ✏️ <b>Edit existing events</b> - Tap on an event to modify its details.
* 🔴 <b>Live preview</b> - See how your event will look as you add or edit it.
* 🚀 <b>Simple introduction</b> - The app provides clear instructions if no events are added.
